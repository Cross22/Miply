## Usage
Click the icons at the bottom to add the action to the MiP's program. You can then drag the rows to re-order instructions.
Initially a crossed out circle is shown in the top-right corner and the app automatically tries to connect to the first available MiP in range. When a connection has been made the icon changes to a play arrow. Press the Play arrow to execute all instructions in the list.
